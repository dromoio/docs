Dromo provides two kinds of webhooks:
* **Managed Webhooks** are managed in the Dromo dashboard. They provide context about the completed import, and can be applied to multiple schemas.
* **Basic webhooks** are configured by setting the [webhookUrl setting](/settings#webhookurl) in your import settings. This webhook can be configured dynamically at the time of import.

## Managed webhooks

Managed webhooks are configured in the dashboard on the [webhooks page](https://dashboard.dromo.io/webhooks). Click on the "New webhook" button to create your first webhook.

There are a few things to specify:
* **URL**: Provide a publicly accessible URL where the webhook should be sent.
* **Development Mode**: Toggle this setting to control whether the webhook fires for development imports or production imports, based on the developmentMode flag. This is helpful for testing webhooks in staging environments.
* **Schemas to Trigger On**: Choose when the webhook should be triggered using either or both of the following:
  * **Import Identifiers**: A list of importIdentifier values. The webhook will fire whenever an import with a matching identifier completes. Useful for dynamic imports.
  * **Saved Schemas**: Select from your predefined schemas in Schema Studio.

You can mix import identifiers and saved schemas as needed.

The next time an import is completed for a matching schema, you will receive a POST request like the following:

<CodeGroup>
```json
{
  "event": "import_completed", 
  "data": {
    "id": "025f399f-4370-4064-aed5-b8d16b597183",
    "filename": "contacts.csv", 
    "user": {
      "id": "user-123",
      "name": "Jasmine Clark",
      "email": "jclark@acme.com",
      "company_id": null,
      "company_name": null
    },
    "created_date": "2024-04-24T17:20:14.659349Z",
    "import_type": "EMBEDDED",
    "status": "SUCCESSFUL",
    "num_data_rows": 433,
    "development_mode": false,
    "has_data": true
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

To get more details about the parameters, expand the following section:

<Expandable title="more about fields in the webhook">
<ResponseField name="event" type="string">
  The event that triggered this webhook. Currently, this will always be `"import_completed"` unless your organization is using Dromo Headless (see below).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data" type="object">
  <ResponseField name="id" type="string">
    The id of the import. You can use this ID with the Dromo Imports API.
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="filename" type="string | null">
    The filename of the file uploaded by the user. This will be `null` if manual input or [initialData](/settings#initialdata) was used.
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="user" type="User">
    The user metadata supplied with this import
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="created_date" type="string">
    The completion time of the import, in ISO-8601 format
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="import_type" type="string">
    `"HEADLESS"` if the import was a Headless import, otherwise `"EMBEDDED"`
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="status" type="string">
    For standard (embedded) imports, currently will always be `"SUCCESSFUL"`. See below for Headless.
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="num_data_rows" type="number">
    The number of rows in the completed import
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="development_mode" type="boolean">
    Whether this import was completed in development mode
  </ResponseField>

  <ResponseField name="has_data" type="boolean">
    Whether the results of this import were saved using [backend sync](/settings#backendsyncmode).

    If `true`, you can fetch the import results using the [get import data endpoint](/api#tag/uploads/operation/getUploadData).
  </ResponseField>
</ResponseField>
</Expandable>

<Note>
  When using managed webhooks with headless imports, Dromo exposes two additional events and data in the webhook:
  * A `"headless_import_needs_review"` event is triggered when a headless import enters the [needs review state](/getting-started/headless#import-needs-review).
  * A `"headless_import_failed"` event is triggered when a headless import encounters an unrecoverable error and goes to the [failed state](/getting-started/headless#import-failed).

  Completed headless imports, whether fully automated or completed using manual review, will trigger the standard `"import_completed"` event as detailed above.

  All headless import webhooks include an additional `"headless"` key in the `data` object. This will include data about the headless import in a format matching the [retrieve headless import endpoint](/api#tag/headless/operation/retrieveHeadlessImport), with the exception that `"review_url"` and `"original_file_download"` are not exposed in the webhook for security reasons.
</Note>

## Basic webhooks

Basic webhooks are triggered when an import is completed, when the settings for that import included a [webhookUrl](/settings#webhookurl).

The webhooks are delivered to the configured URL via POST request in URL-encoded form format, and contain only a single key, `uploadId`.

<CodeGroup>
```sh
uploadId=7df3a66d-b7bb-4da6-9244-b4e22c7d7ab0
```
</CodeGroup>

This key can be used to fetch import data and metadata using the [Dromo API](https://developer.dromo.io/api#tag/uploads).
