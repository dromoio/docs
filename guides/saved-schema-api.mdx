description: "In addition to using Dromo's intuitive , you can also create, edit and delete saved schemas directly via API."
---

Working with the API allows you to access the complete array of settings and options that Dromo provides.

## The API[​](#the-api "Direct link to The API")

Dromo provides a standard REST API for working with schemas. The API provides standard CRUD operations for saved schemas.

You can view the full Saved Schema API reference [here](/api#tag/import-schemas).

## Saved Schema Structure[​](#saved-schema-structure "Direct link to Saved Schema Structure")

Schemas have the following fields:

* idstring

  Schemas are automatically assigned a UUID when they are created.

* namestringRequired

  Schemas must have a unique name within your organization.

  Schema names are displayed in the Dromo dashboard.

* settings[Settings](/settings)Required

  Saved schemas accept the same settings that can be provided to the browser SDK.

* fields[Field\[\]](/fields#field-object-reference)Required

  Schemas have an array of fields which also accept the same full set of options as the browser SDK.

* hooks

  You can define any or all of the [hooks](/hooks) that Dromo provides using the Saved Schema API.

  The hook function JavaScript source is passed as a string, which must evaluate to a valid JavaScript function. See the [defining hooks section](#defining-hooks) for examples.

  All hooks are optional.

  * rowHooksstring\[]

    An array of strings defining valid JavaScript [standard row hooks](/hooks#standard-row-hooks).

  * bulkRowHooksstring\[]

    An array of strings defining valid JavaScript [bulk row hooks](/hooks#bulk-row-hooks).

  * rowDeleteHooksstring\[]

    An array of strings defining valid JavaScript [row delete hooks](/hooks#row-delete-hooks).

  * columnHooks\{ fieldName: string, callback: string }\[]

    An array of objects defining [column hooks](/hooks#column-hooks).

    Each column hook has a `fieldName` specifying which column the hook will run on, and a `callback` defining a valid JavaScript column hook function.

  * stepHooks\{ type: string, callback: string }\[]

    An array of objects defining [step hooks](/hooks#step-hooks).

    Each step hook has a `type` (one of `"UPLOAD_STEP"`, `"REVIEW_STEP"`, or `"REVIEW_STEP_POST_HOOKS"`) and a `callback` defining a valid JavaScript column hook function.

  * beforeFinishCallbackstring

    An string defining a valid JavaScript [before finish callback](/results#the-beforefinish-callback).

## Defining hooks[​](#defining-hooks "Direct link to Defining hooks")

Hook functions are defined using strings containing JavaScript source code. The code is evaluated in the end user's browser for standard imports, and using Node.js 18 for headless imports.

All types of function declarations are accepted:

* Anonymous function expression: `function(a, b) { return a + b; }`
* Named function expression: `function sum(a, b) { return a + b; }`
* Arrow function: `(a, b) => { return a + b; }`

  <Accordion title="Row hook example">
    To define a row hook, you could pass the following to the API's \`hooks\` parameter:

    ```
    {  "rowHooks": [    "(record, mode) => { record.row.zipCode.value = record.row.zipCode.value.padStart(5, '0'); return record; }"  ]}
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Step hook example">
    To define a step hook, you could pass the following to the API's \`hooks\` parameter:

    ```
    {  "stepHooks": [    {      "type": "REVIEW_STEP",      "callback": "(instance) => instance.addField({ label: 'Full Name', key: 'fullName' })"    }  ]}
    ```

## Using saved schemas[​](#using-saved-schemas "Direct link to Using saved schemas")

Saved schemas can be used [in the browser](/guides/schema-builder) or using the [Headless API](/getting-started/headless).
