Bring Your Own Storage (BYOS) allows import data to be sent from the Dromo JS widget in your user's browser directly to your cloud storage bucket, without Dromo ever having access to the data.

<Info>
  BYOS is only available on the Enterprise Plan.

## BYOS Requirements and Setup[​](#byos-requirements-and-setup "Direct link to BYOS Requirements and Setup")

BYOS supports AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage. You will need to have configuration access to prepare your storage layer for receiving data from Dromo. Dromo will need **write-only** access, which will be used to generate pre-signed upload URLS used by the Dromo importer widget.

The Dromo Solution Engineering team will guide you through the setup process.

## Using BYOS[​](#using-byos "Direct link to Using BYOS")

Once configured, ensure [`settings: backendSycMode`](/settings#backendsyncmode) is set to `"FULL_DATA"`. All your imports will automatically be uploaded to the bucket associated with the account the API key belongs to. The raw import file will also be stored in your storage layer.

After the import is completed, Dromo's backend will send any configured webhooks for the import. You can also use the ID of the completed import to [fetch the import metadata](/api#tag/uploads/operation/getUploadMetadata) from Dromo's API.
