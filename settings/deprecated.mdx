<ResponseField name="allowInvalidSubmit" type="boolean" default="false">
  <Warning>
    `allowInvalidSubmit` is deprecated in favor of the `invalidDataBehavior` setting.

    `allowInvalidSubmit = false` is equivalent to `invalidDataBehavior = "REMOVE_INVALID_ROWS"`.

    `allowInvalidSubmit = true` is equivalent to `invalidDataBehavior = "INCLUDE_INVALID_ROWS"`.
  </Warning>

  This option impacts the messaging on the final screen before submitting data. When this is set to `false`, Dromo will discard the records with errors and the user will see "Discard *X* rows with issues. Submit the rest." When this is set to `true`, Dromo will submit the records with errors and the user will see "Submit your data anyway (errors may occur).":
