description: "Dromo's Hooks help you reformat, validate, and correct data automatically via custom functions per column and/or row. For example, using these hooks you can automatically reformat area codes or country codes, remove special characters, validate emails against external data, or anything else you can think of."
---

The diagram below shows the general flow for Dromo. Column hooks run first and only once after the "column matching" stage. After these run, row hooks will run for each record. Row hooks will also run on a record after it is updated by the user. If you only want to run a row hook on init or on change, you can configure it accordingly.

## Column hooks[​](#column-hooks "Direct link to Column hooks")

Column hooks run on a specified column at the beginning of the data review step. They are run before the row hooks and will only run once during the import process.

Column hooks are called with a single argument, `values`, with an array of objects. Each object corresponds to one value in the column, and has two parameters.

<ResponseField name="index" type="number">
  The row index of the column value, starting with 0
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="value" type="string">
  The raw value as imported
</ResponseField>

Column hooks must return an array of objects in a similar format.

Column hooks may return the value async, wrapped in a promise.

<ResponseField name="index" type="number" required>
  The row index of the column value. This should be unchanged from the input.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="value" type="string">
  The new value for this cell. If omitted, the value is left unchanged.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="info" type="InfoMessage[]">
  An array of messages you would like to add to this cell.

  For more details, see [Info Messages](#working-with-info-messages).

  If omitted, no messages are added.
</ResponseField>

  <Accordion title="Sample input and output">
    Given the following imported data:

    |      Name     |                         Email                         |
    | :-----------: | :---------------------------------------------------: |
    |  Michelle Doe | [michelledoe@gmail.com](mailto:michelledoe@gmail.com) |
    |    Jane Doe   |     [janedoe@gmail.com](mailto:janedoe@gmail.com)     |
    |  Steve Jones  |     [steve@hotmail.com](mailto:steve@hotmail.com)     |
    | Wayne Gretzky |         [wayne@nhl.com](mailto:wayne@nhl.com)         |

    A column hook registered on the `Email` field would be passed the following data:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```javascript Input
    [
      { value: "michelledoe@gmail.com", index: 0 },
      { value: "janedoe@gmail.com", index: 1 },
      { value: "steve@hotmail.com", index: 2 },
      { value: "wayne@nhl.com", index: 3 },
    ];
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    This column hook could return something like this:

    <CodeGroup>
    ```javascript Output

      {
        index: 0,
        value: "michelledoe@aol.com",

## Row hooks[​](#row-hooks "Direct link to Row hooks")

Row hooks run validation on each record (row) of data and return the record with new data and/or user messages. Row hooks come in two variants: standard and bulk.

Row hooks are run once in `"init"` mode after the column matching step and before the user begins the review step, and are run with the full dataset.

Row hooks are run again in `"update"` mode after each time the user changes any data, with only the changed rows.

### Standard row hooks[​](#standard-row-hooks "Direct link to Standard row hooks")

Standard row hooks are invoked once for every row on `init`, and once for every row that changed on `update`.

Standard row hooks are called with two arguments.

* recordobject

  * indexnumber

    The index of this row

  * rowobject

    The `row` object will have keys matching the field key of each mapped field. Each of these keys will contain an object with data and metadata of that field in the given row.

    * valuestring

      The value of this field at this row, as displayed to the user

    * resultValuestring | boolean | number | null

      The value of this field at this row, as it will appear in the result data

    * info[InfoMessage\[\]](#working-with-info-messages)

      An array of any info messages you have previously added to this cell

    * selectOptions\{ label: string, value: string }\[]

      Overridden selectOptions previously added to this cell

* mode"init" | "update"

  Mode will be `"init"` if running before the start of the review step, and `"update"` if running due to a user change.

* manyToOne\{ value: string, resultValue: string | boolean | number | null, info: InfoMessage\[], selectOptions: \{ label: string, value: string }\[] }\[]

  If the field is [manyToOne](/fields/#manyToOne), every mapped cell for this row appears as an array.

Row hooks should return the updated record in a similar format.

Row hooks may return the value async, wrapped in a promise.

* rowobjectRequired

  The `row` object should contain keys matching the field key of each mapped field. If a mapped field is omitted, it will remain unchanged.

  Each field key object may have the following entries:

  * valuestring

    The new value for this row

  * info[InfoMessage\[\]](#working-with-info-messages)

    New messages for this row. Messages returned will replace any previously set messages. If `info` is omitted, messages will remain unchanged.

  * selectOptions\{ label: string, value: string }\[]

    Select option overrides for this cell. If provided, the cell will use these select options for transforming values and validating instead of those set when the field was declared.

<Info>
  When fetching external data, we recommend that you make any API calls in a column hook and then validate that the data remains correct using a row hook in `update` mode.

### Bulk row hooks[​](#bulk-row-hooks "Direct link to Bulk row hooks")

Bulk row hooks are invoked a single time on `init` with the full dataset, and a single time on `update` with all of the changed rows.

Bulk row hooks are a good fit if you need to perform potentially long-running operations that can be optimized by processing all changes in a single function call.

Bulk row hooks work exactly like standard row hooks, except the first parameter is an array of record objects instead of a single record object. Similarly, bulk row hooks must return an array of record objects, preserving the `index` parameter of each record.

## Row delete hooks[​](#row-delete-hooks "Direct link to Row delete hooks")

Row delete hooks are called when a row (or rows) is removed from the table by the user.

Row delete hooks are called once for each row that was removed.

* recordobject

  * indexnumber

    The index of this row

  * rowobject

    The `row` object will have keys matching the field key of each mapped field. Each of these keys will contain an object with data and metadata of that field in the given row.

    * valuestring

      The value of this field at this row, as displayed to the user

    * resultValuestring | boolean | number | null

      The value of this field at this row, as it will appear in the result data

    * info[InfoMessage\[\]](#working-with-info-messages)

## Step hooks[​](#step-hooks "Direct link to Step hooks")

Step hooks are callbacks that are invoked at different parts of the import process. In addition to fetching metadata about the import at that time, you can use them to call mutation functions like [`addField`](#instanceaddfield).

### `UPLOAD_STEP` hook[​](#upload_step-hook "Direct link to upload_step-hook")

### `REVIEW_STEP_PRE_SUBMIT` hook[​](#review_step_pre_submit-hook "Direct link to review_step_pre_submit-hook")

This hook is triggered during the review step right after the user clicks 'Finish' but before [`beforeFinish`](/results#the-beforefinish-callback) runs. It can be useful for customizing the 'Are you ready to submit?' dialog with info summarizing the changes and impact of the import data.

The function is called with two arguments.

* instance[DromoUploader](#the-dromo-uploader-instance)

  The Dromo Uploader instance which you can call mutation methods on

* reviewStepDataobject

  * headerMapping\{ \[header: string]: string }

    An object whose keys are the file headers and values are the field keys of the field the header was mapped to

  * fieldsobject

    An object whose keys are the field keys and values are objects containing metadata about that field

    * fileHeaderstring | null

      The header this field was mapped to. `null` if no file was uploaded.

## Working with info messages[​](#working-with-info-messages "Direct link to Working with info messages")

Dromo offers the ability to add info messages to data cells to enable custom validation and provide other feedback to the user.

You can add and update info messages via [column hooks](#column-hooks), [row hooks](#row-hooks), and [the updateInfoMessages method](#instanceupdateinfomessages) in step hooks.

Info messages are provided as objects with these parameters.

* messagestringRequired

  The message to be displayed to the user in the review screen when they hover over the corresponding cell

* level"info" | "warning" | "error"

  Default: "error"

  The nature of the message.

  * A cell with an `"error"` message is highlighted in red. It is considered a validation error and impacts the user's submission options based on [`invalidDataBehavior`](/settings#invaliddatabehavior)
  * A cell with a `"warning"` message is highlighted in yellow
  * A cell with an `"info"` message is highlighted in blue

## The Dromo Uploader instance[​](#the-dromo-uploader-instance "Direct link to The Dromo Uploader instance")

Step hooks provide access to the Dromo Uploader instance, which exposes methods to alter the import.

### `instance.addField`[​](#instanceaddfield "Direct link to instanceaddfield")

Adds a field to the schema after a step hook has completed.

By default, the field will be added to the end of the fields.

You may optionally provide a position object specifying where in the list of fields to insert the new one.

* field[Field](/fields#field-object-reference)Required

  A field spec for the new field to add

* position\{ before: string } | \{ after: string }

  Specifies where in the list of fields to add the new one.

  If provided, must be an object of the form `{ before: fieldKey }` or `{ after: fieldKey }` where `fieldKey` is the `key` of a mapped field. If no mapped field with the given key exists, the new field will be added to the end.

</Check>

### `instance.removeField`[​](#instanceremovefield "Direct link to instanceremovefield")

Removes a field after a step hook has completed.

The field will no longer be visible on the data review screen nor included in the result data. Any validation errors or info messages will be discarded.

Can be used in conjuction with [`addField`](/hooks#instanceaddfield) to concatenate columns and remove the originals, i.e. combine `firstName` + `lastName` into `fullName` and remove `firstName` and `lastName` from the result data.

* fieldKeystringRequired

  Key of the field to be deleted.

### `instance.updateInfoMessages`[​](#instanceupdateinfomessages "Direct link to instanceupdateinfomessages")

Updates the messages for targeted cells, overwriting any previous messages.

* updatesobject\[]Required

  An array of objects with an object for each cell to update the messages on

  * rowIndexnumberRequired

    The 0-indexed position of the row you are targeting

  * fieldKeystringRequired

    The key of the [field](/fields) you are targeting

  * manyToOneIndexnumber

    If `manyToOne` is enabled on a field, you can use this property to select which mapped column shall receive the updates.

  * messages[InfoMessage\[\]](#working-with-info-messages)Required

    An array of [infoMessages](#working-with-info-messages) which will be set for the cell at the specified row and field.

    An empty array will clear existing messages from the cell.

  In this case, if you had previously set a message on the email field of row 3 or the phone field of row 8, these messages would be replaced with the new ones.

  <CodeGroup>
  ```javascript
  instance.updateInfoMessages([
    {
      rowIndex: 3,
      fieldKey: "email",
      messages: [{ level: "warning", message: "Email has not been confirmed" }],
    },
    {
      rowIndex: 8,
      fieldKey: "phone",
      messages: [{ level: "error", message: "Phone number not in database" }],
    },
  ]);
  ```

Adds rows to the dataset. Returns an array of row IDs for the rows that were just added.

* rowsobject\[]Required

  Rows to be added to the dataset.

  * indexnumber

    Index where this row will be inserted. If omitted, row will be added to end of the dataset.

    * info[InfoMessage\[\]](#working-with-info-messages)

      Info messages for this row.

    * selectOptions\{ label: string, value: string }\[]

      Select option overrides for this cell. If provided, the cell will use these select options for transforming values and validating instead of those set when the field was declared.
